  - "The FitnessGram\u2122 Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that
    progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will
    begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but
    gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should
    be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight
    line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap
    before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On
    your mark, get ready, start."
